  * Phlebotomy Handbook, Ninth Editionlinks health care students and providers to the latest information, procedures, skills, standards, and equipment for safe, effective blood collection. Its contents have been selected and organized to improve diagnostic and therapeutic laboratory testing through better pre-exam blood collection knowledge, and by teaching skills that lead to better patient outcomes. Starting simple, it builds to increasingly complex competencies, covering all the crucial communication, clinical, technical, and safety skills that health care practitioners need. This edition fully reflects the latest guidelines from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS), with references to international standards as appropriate. It also reflects an even stronger focus on patient and healthcare provider safety. Also available: access to Pearson's state-of-the-art MyHealthProfessionsLab, and a complete eText version of the book.
